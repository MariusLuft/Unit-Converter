# Unit-Converter-PWA
A replicate of the unit converter from google. It's implemented as a progressive web app (pwa) with a so called service worker that serves with offline functionality due to optimized caching.

# How to open: 
      
                  To access the unit converter, just open the index.html document in your browser.
                  
# How to use: 
  
                  You can choose between Velocity, Time, Surface area and Energy. 
                  You can then choose the units that you intend to convert to or from. 
                  The converter will immeadiately do its job without any further buttons pressed.
